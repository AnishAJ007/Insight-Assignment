- Responsive Design Implementation : This incorporates responsive design principles to ensure optimal viewing and interaction experiences across a wide range of devices and screen sizes. The following specific aspects demonstrate the responsiveness of our website:

Flexbox Layout: We use CSS Flexbox to structure and align elements dynamically, allowing content to adapt fluidly based on screen width.

Media Queries: We employ media queries to apply different styles based on the device's screen size. This ensures that content and layout adjustments are made for various breakpoints.

Viewport Meta Tag: We include the viewport meta tag in our HTML to ensure proper scaling and responsiveness on mobile devices.

Fluid Images: Images are styled using max-width: 100%; to ensure they scale appropriately within their containers, preventing overflow and maintaining aspect ratios.

Responsive Navigation: Our sidebar navigation transforms into a dropdown menu on smaller screens (768px or less), providing a more user-friendly experience on mobile devices.

Button Sizing: Buttons are styled with relative units (e.g., percentages, ems) to maintain consistent proportions and adapt to different screen sizes.


These responsive design techniques collectively ensure that our website offers a seamless and accessible experience across desktops, tablets, and smartphones. The layout and content dynamically adjust to provide the best presentation and usability for each user's device, emphasizing usability and accessibility.
